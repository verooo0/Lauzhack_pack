# Lauzhack_pack

This project for the LauzHack 2024 from the sponsor BOBST consists in a 'Mini Smart Factory' that controls the production and the quality of the product itself.

It's based on a Raspberry pi 5 and it uses an IR sensor, ultrasound sensor and a Servo motor to simulate a production line.
